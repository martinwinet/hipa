**Posting Restrictions**

When you create your own personalized account, you are able to provide content to the service. You are solely responsible for the user content that you generate. You agree that we are only acting as a passive conduit for the publication of your user content. We, however, reserves the right to remove any user content from the service at its sole discretion. We grant you permission to use and access the service, subject to the following conditions surrounding user content. You agree that failure to adhere to any of these conditions constitutes a breach of these terms. By transmitting and submitting any user content while using the service, you agree as follows:
- You are solely responsible for your account and the activity that occurs while signed in to or while using your account
- You will not post any information that is malicious, false, abusive, threatening, obscene, defamatory, libelous, or racially, sexually, religiously, or otherwise objectionable and offensive

- You will not submit content that is copyrighted or subject to third party proprietary rights, including privacy, publicity, or others, unless you are the owner of such rights or have the appropriate permission from their rightful owner to specifically submit such content

You hereby agree that we have the right to determine whether your user content submissions are appropriate and comply with these terms of service, remove any and/or all of your submissions, and terminate your account with or without prior notice.
You understand and agree that any liability, loss or damage that occurs as a result of the use of any user content that you make available or access through your use of the service is solely your responsibility. hipa is not responsible for any public display or misuse of your user content.

hipa does not, and cannot, pre-screen or monitor all user content. However, at our discretion, we, or technology we employ, may monitor and/or record your interactions with the service or with other users.

**Terms and Conditions**

By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify the app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to the author.

I am committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, I reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. I will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you are paying for.

The hipa app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to provide my service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. I therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the hipa app won’t work properly or at all.

The app does use third party services that declare their own terms and conditions.

You should be aware that there are certain things that I will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but I cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you do not have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data allowance left.

If you are using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you are accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that I assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.

At some point, I may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. I do not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

**Changes**

I may update these terms and conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new terms and conditions on this page.

These terms and conditions are effective as of 2021-03-05
